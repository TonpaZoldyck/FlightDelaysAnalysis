# Flight Delays Analysis Project Summary

## Goal

The primary objective was to analyze US domestic flight delays during the holiday season in November and December 2021. The project aimed to understand delay patterns, investigating temporal, regional, and carrier-specific aspects impacting flight punctuality.

## Work Done

Exploratory Analysis: Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis on delay distributions, examining carrier-wise delay trends, temporal variations, and regional influences.
Data Preparation: Employed Power BI and SQL for efficient data preparation, data exploration, and data collection, enhancing data quality for subsequent analyses.
Insightful Visualizations: Developed professional dashboards and visualizations highlighting delay distributions by carriers, timings, days, and states, utilizing Python and Power BI for visualization.
Machine Learning Application: Utilized machine learning models for predicting and understanding delay patterns, emphasizing Python for modeling tasks.

## Outcomes

Insights into Delay Dynamics: Revealed critical delay patterns across different time frames, days, and geographical regions, attributing causes to carrier, NAS, late aircraft, and weather-related factors.
Strategic Implications: Demonstrated the significance of machine learning in predicting flight delays, paving the way for strategic interventions to enhance flight punctuality.
